### Short Description

Basically I created an example store implemented in Rails 5.2 using the Shopr gem and Bootstrap 4 UI.
Than I open-sourced this shop example.

Shopr gem is the Shopify small flexible alternative which sadle was abandoned by creators in late 2016.
So I hooked up this gem, rolling small updates and keeping it in actual state (supporting Rails 5.2 etc.)
