### Short Description

Basically I created an example store implemented in Rails using the Shopr gem and Bootstrap 4 UI.
Then I open-sourced this **shop example** (1).

**Shopr gem is the Shopify small flexible alternative** (2) which sadly was abandoned by creators in late 2016. Technically this is a Rails engine which make it possible to add e-commerce functionality to any Rails application.
So I snap up this gem, rolling small updates and keeping it in actual state (supporting Rails 5.2 etc.)
