### Short Description

**CryptedHash** great idea to powerful ruby gem. But it's author has forgotten about project. Empty repo, no documentation, ets.

I want to contribute and help to realise him idea. But I can't, because this project doesn't have something to explain about what
this gem. And I implemented new README version, because without documentation no one project can't work. I hope this PR remind it's
creator about this great idea and he will start to work on the project
