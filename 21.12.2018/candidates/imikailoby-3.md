### Short Description

**redux-token-auth** - the raddest client-side solution for user authentication using React and Redux with a
Rails backend that uses Devise Token Auth.

Current master branch contain a lot of useful changes and fixes what current npm version doesn't include. Npm
package doesn't update 4 months!

With this issue, I want to remind the creator of the package that many use it and would like to see timely
updates that include fixes for many errors of the current version of the package.
