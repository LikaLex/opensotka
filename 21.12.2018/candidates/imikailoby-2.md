### Short Description

**currency-rate** gem-converter for fiat and crypto currencies.

Gem is very powerful, but it have one drawback: lack of output. After running gem you can understand all works fine or
no only if you open generated logs. I added outuput to thes gem to showing output into console about what adapters synced,
what failed, current currency rates what gem fetched.

I also covered the code with tests to make sure everything worked. And fixed a typo in gem.
